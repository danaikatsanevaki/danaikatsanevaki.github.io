abstract: Mutations in *SYNGAP1* are a common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID) and a risk factor for autism. *SYNGAP1* encodes a synaptic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that has both signaling and scaffolding roles. Most pathogenic variants of *SYNGAP1* are predicted to result in haploinsufficiency. However, some affected individuals carry missense mutations in its calcium/lipid binding (C2) and GAP domains, suggesting that many clinical features result from loss of functions carried out by these domains. To test this hypothesis, we targeted the exons encoding the C2 and GAP domains of SYNGAP. Rats heterozygous for this deletion exhibit reduced exploration and fear extinction, altered social investigation, and spontaneous seizuresâ€”key phenotypes shared with Syngap heterozygous null rats. Together, these findings indicate that the reduction of SYNGAP C2/GAP domain function is a main feature of SYNGAP haploinsufficiency. This rat model provides an important system for the study of ID, autism, and epilepsy.
