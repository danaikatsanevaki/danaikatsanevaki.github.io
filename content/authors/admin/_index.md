## About Me

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Rochefort Lab](https://rochefortlab.co.uk/), based at the [Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences](https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/) and the [Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain](https://www.sidb.org.uk/), University of Edinburgh. I'm fascinated by how networks of neurons process sensory information and shape our interactions with the world, and how that ability adapts or differs in neurodevelopmental conditions.
